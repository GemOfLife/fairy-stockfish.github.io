# Fairy-Stockfish

Fairy-Stockfish is a chess variant engine derived from [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) designed for the support of fairy chess variants and easy extensibility with more games.

## Variants

It can play [various regional, historical, and modern chess variants](/variants/) such as
* Xiangqi
* Janggi
* Shogi
* Makruk
* Crazyhouse
* Atomic
* and [many more](/variants/), including [games with user-defined rules](/custom-variants/)

## Playing strength
Despite Fairy-Stockfish's generality the playing strength is on a very high level in almost all supported variants, especially when using [NNUE](/about-nnue/). To only name a few it is the world's strongest engine in Janggi, Crazyhouse, S-Chess, etc.

## Usage
For compatibility with [graphical user interfaces](/gui/) Fairy-Stockfish supports the UCI, UCCI, USI, UCI-cyclone, and CECP/XBoard protocols.
