Below is an overview of the latest release binaries for Fairy-Stockfish. You should select the download according to three criteria:
1. Your operating system, see the Windows and Linux sections below.
2. Your hardware. In doubt use a "64-bit" version, on most recent computers "modern" should work and is faster.
3. Depending on the variants you are interested in, choose one of
  * all variants - most complete version with all variants included
  * 8x8 variants - only supports board sizes <= 8x8, e.g., sufficient for all lichess variants
  * xiangqi - Includes the strongest NNUE for xiangqi
  * janggi - Includes the strongest NNUE for janggi
  * makruk - Includes the strongest NNUE for makruk

After downloading the engine you can then also download [NNUE files](/nnue/) for your favorite variants to improve playing strength if desired. You can skip this step if you download one of the specialized versions (xiangqi/janggi/makruk) that already include the NNUE in the engine itself for convenience.
