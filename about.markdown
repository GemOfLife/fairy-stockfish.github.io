## About Fairy-Stockfish
The development of the Fairy-Stockfish engine started in 2018 by Fabian Fichter based on [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) after previous experiments with more specialized Stockfish chess variant forks that lead to the idea of creating a more generic engine with easy extensibility but still using the powerful Stockfish engine as a basis. Over time it became the strongest chess variant engine in a large variety of games, especially after the advent of NNUE, and is now powering analysis and play against the computer on several chess (variant) websites, such as [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) and [pychess.org](https://www.pychess.org/).
